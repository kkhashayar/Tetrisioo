# Tetrisioo
simple tetris game

python3 and turtle module

surprisingly turtle is very powerful tool, either on assisting to learn different 
concepts of programming and internal logic of the code or helping to write arcade games
of course pygame would be another perfect option for game development but for classic arcade 
games turtle is more than enough good.

Specifically for this code, I use turtle to avoid writing matrix rotator!
I used rotator function from turtle class.

game have only one level and increase the speed only one time during the game, 
I haven't write a score recorder function for it. 

for sound I used pygame mixer with ogg files which I find very light and fast in term of using memory 
and avoiding interruption with the code, the problem which sometimes can arise using winsound!.
