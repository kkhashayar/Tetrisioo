simple tetris game

python3 and turtle module

surprisingly turtle is a very powerful tool, either on assisting to learn different 
concepts of programming and internal logic of the code or helping to write simple games.
of course pygame would be a better option for game development but for classic arcade 
games turtle will get the job done.

specially for this game, I use turtle to avoid writing matrix rotator!
I used rotator function from turtle class.

game only have one level which increasees the game speed only one time during the game play. 
I haven't write a score recorder function for it. 

for sound I used pygame mixer with ogg files which I find very light and fast in term of using memory 
and avoiding interruption with the code, the problem which sometimes can arise using winsound!.
