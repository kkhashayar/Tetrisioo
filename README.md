simple tetris game

python3 and turtle module

surprisingly turtle is a very powerful tool, either on assisting to learn different 
concepts of programming and internal logic of the code or helping to write simple games.
of course pygame would be a better option for game development but for classic arcade 
games turtle will get the job done.

specially for this game, I use turtle to avoid writing matrix rotator!
I used rotator function from turtle class.

game only have one level which increasees the game speed only one time during the game play. 
I haven't write a score recorder function for it. 

for sound I used pygame mixer with ogg files which I find very light and fast in term of using memory 
and avoiding interruption with the code, the problem which sometimes can arise using winsound!.

Now that i look at the code i see some of the methods were experimental and in final stage i didnt even use them but i wouldnt remove the from code just as a reminder.
in my opinion Code is very Bad!, The logic of the code is very complex, and i might repeated myself in many places.
i had many mistakes in the structure which makes it very hard to follow the logic of the game.
one reason for complex logic is the nature of using turtle stamp() method. 
i hope some one can help me to refactor the game.
